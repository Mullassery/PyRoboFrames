# PyRoboFrames Roadmap — "Train Anywhere"

> The near-term roadmap. For the original v0.1 build sequence see
> [`IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`](./IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md); for the competitive analysis see
> [`COMPARISON.md`](./COMPARISON.md).

## North star: one script, six targets

The same training/data script must run **unchanged** on every target below. The environment —
not edits to the code — selects the backend. The script never says `if cuda: ... else: ...`.

| Target | Decode | Compute / transforms | Tensor output |
|---|---|---|---|
| MacBook (Apple Silicon) — **MLX** | VideoToolbox → FFmpeg | MLX | `mlx.core.array` |
| MacBook (Apple Silicon) — **MPS** | VideoToolbox → FFmpeg | Torch (MPS) | `torch.Tensor` (mps) |
| **RTX 5090** | NVDEC (FFmpeg `-hwaccel cuda`) | **CV-CUDA** | `torch.Tensor` (cuda) |
| **H100** | NVDEC | **CV-CUDA** | `torch.Tensor` (cuda) |
| **RunPod** (rented NVIDIA) | NVDEC | **CV-CUDA** | `torch.Tensor` (cuda) |
| **Local CPU** | FFmpeg (software) | NumPy / Torch (CPU) | `np.ndarray` / `torch.Tensor` |

Most robotics tooling is NVIDIA-first. PyRoboFrames' wedge is treating **Apple Silicon and CUDA
as equal citizens** behind a superior LeRobot data pipeline — a position nothing else occupies.

### What "no code changes" means concretely

```python
import pyroboframes as prf

ds = prf.RoboFrameDataset.from_path("…/my_lerobot_dataset")
loader = ds.loader(
    batch_size=32,
    cameras=["observation.images.top"],
    transforms=prf.transforms.Compose([
        prf.transforms.Resize(224, 224),
        prf.transforms.Normalize(mean=[0.485, 0.456, 0.406], std=[0.229, 0.224, 0.225]),
    ]),
    # device="auto" (default): CUDA → MPS/MLX on a Mac → CPU. Override with device=… or
    # the PYROBOFRAMES_DEVICE env var. transforms dispatch to CV-CUDA / MLX / Torch / NumPy.
)
for batch in loader:        # tensors already on the right device, in the right framework
    train_step(batch)
```

## Prioritized plan (current — 2026-06-25, after 0.1.6)

This is the **authoritative ordering**. The sections below it (test-first P0–P2, ease-sorted
backlog, Tier 1/2 lens, long-range vision) are kept as reference/detail. Effort: `S`≈1–2d ·
`M`≈3–7d · `L`≈1–2wk+ · `XL`=research/blocked. `[C]` = needs NVIDIA hardware to verify.

**Where we are (0.1.6):** the *fast LeRobot loader* is largely built — read v3.0, state/action +
camera frames, windows, shuffle/balanced sampling, train/val split, stats + normalization,
checkpoint/resume, off-GIL prefetch (~2.7× on decode), NumPy/MLX/PyTorch output, device seam
(`resolve_device`/`DataLoader`), CPU image transforms, throughput harness. So the next priorities
shift from *loader plumbing* to **(a) making the loader production-grade, then (b) the Tier-1
"data platform" identity, then (c) Tier-2 vision intelligence.**

**Ranking rule (per your call):** items float up by **testable-now + high-value + low-effort**;
GPU-only (`[C]`, can't verify here) and research/heavy items sink. Each line is tagged
`effort · value · ✓test (or [C])`.

### P1 — Quick high-value wins (testable now, `S`/`XS`) — do first
- [ ] **JAX** output/loader adapter — `S · high · ✓test` (completes MLX/PyTorch/JAX; small)
- [ ] Bilinear/area **Resize** + **flip/crop-jitter/color** augments — `S · high · ✓test`
      (replaces nearest-only; most-used vision path)
- [ ] **Episode-chunking** sampler — `S · med-high · ✓test`
- [ ] **MLX** sequence batching + MLX benchmarks — `S · med-high · ✓test` (Apple story)
- [ ] **Performance reporting** (per-batch timings) + **profiling hooks** — `XS · med · ✓test`

### P2 — High-value, medium effort (testable now, `M`)
- [ ] **Lazy loading / mmap parquet** — `M · high · ✓test` (datasets > RAM)
- [ ] Multi-camera batch transforms + **windowed video sync** — `M · high · ✓test`
- [ ] **Curriculum** + **goal-conditioned** sampling — `M · med-high · ✓test`
- [ ] **CLIP embeddings** over frames — `M · high · ✓test` (Tier-2 entry: run model, store vectors)

### P3 — Tier-1 platform identity (testable, high value, large `L`)
*High strategic value but bigger builds, so they sit below the cheap wins.*
- [ ] **MCAP → columnar (Parquet)** converter — `L · very-high · ✓test` (most identity-defining,
      self-contained → recommended first big milestone)
- [ ] **Robotics DataFrame** abstraction — `L · high · ✓test`
- [ ] **LeRobot write-back** (+ HF Hub streaming) — `L · high · ✓test` (streaming part is network)
- [ ] **Time-synchronized multi-sensor fusion** / multi-rate alignment — `L · high · ✓test`
- [ ] **MQTT / Kafka ingestion** + stream-to-dataset writer — `L · high · ~test (needs broker)`

### P4 — Tier-2 vision intelligence (heavy models)
- [ ] **SAM/SAM2** masks + **Grounding DINO** detection → auto-annotation — `L · high · ~test`
- [ ] **Vision-language dataset generation** — `L · high · ~test`

### P5 — NVIDIA / GPU path (can't verify here) `[C]`
- [ ] CUDA/NVDEC decode (`-hwaccel cuda`) — `S · med · [C]`
- [ ] **CV-CUDA** transform backend — `M · high · [C]`
- [ ] NVIDIA throughput benchmark — `M · med · [C]`
- [ ] GPU-resident zero-copy (Video Codec SDK → DLPack) — `XL · high · [C]`

### P6 — Scale, training & research (later)
- [ ] Checkpointing/eval — `M` · BC/fine-tuning — `L` · distributed dataloading / multi-GPU — `L` ·
      Ray/Slurm/RunPod — `L`
- [ ] **Deferred/research:** zero-copy MLX (blocked `mlx#2855`) · MLX distributed · ACT/Diffusion/VLA — `XL`

**Recommended next action:** clear **P1** (JAX + real transforms/augments + sampling — all cheap,
testable, user-visible), then take **MCAP→columnar** (P3) as the first platform milestone.

## Prioritization principle: test-first

Work is ordered by **how it can be verified**, not by how exciting it is. Anything we can prove
correct on commodity hardware (this Mac, any CPU) ships and lands first; anything that needs
NVIDIA silicon is built behind a feature/fallback now but its *functional* sign-off waits for a
GPU box. This keeps every merged change verifiable by CI / the maintainer's laptop.

| Tier | Verifiable on | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| **A** | Any CPU / this Mac (no GPU) | Build **and** functionally test now. Highest priority. |
| **B** | Apple-Silicon GPU (MLX / MPS) | Testable on the maintainer's MacBook. |
| **C** | NVIDIA GPU (RTX 5090 / H100 / RunPod) | Code + compile + lint now; **functional verify deferred** to a GPU box. |

---

## P0 — Backend-agnostic core (Tier A — no GPU needed, do first)

The seam that makes "Train Anywhere" possible. All of this is unit-testable on CPU/this Mac.

- [ ] **Backend detection** (`backend.py`): resolve `device="auto"` → one of `cuda | mps | mlx |
      cpu` at runtime; honor `device=` arg and `PYROBOFRAMES_DEVICE` env override. *Test:* monkeypatch
      capability probes → assert the resolved backend + override precedence.
- [ ] **Unified tensor/output abstraction**: loader auto-selects the native framework per backend
      (Torch on cuda/mps/cpu, MLX on Apple-MLX, NumPy fallback) instead of a manual `output=`.
      Keep `output=` as an explicit override. *Test:* numpy + torch-cpu + mlx paths on this Mac.
- [ ] **Unified transforms API** (`transforms.py`): `Compose`, `Resize`, `CenterCrop`,
      `RandomCrop`, `Normalize`, `RandomHorizontalFlip` — one API, backend-dispatched. Ship the
      **CPU/Torch** implementation first. *Test:* shape/dtype/value correctness vs a NumPy reference.
- [ ] **Automatic fallback chain** + capability detection: `CV-CUDA → Torch → NumPy`; a missing
      `cvcuda`/GPU degrades gracefully with a clear log, never an error. *Test:* force each rung.
- [ ] **Rust `CudaDecoder` (NVDEC via FFmpeg `-hwaccel cuda`)**: replace the stub with a real
      implementation that reuses the existing FFmpeg-CLI path plus CUDA hwaccel flags; wire
      `Backend::preferred()` runtime selection. *Test here:* `cargo clippy --features cuda` +
      structural unit tests (the CLI/parse logic is shared with the verified FFmpeg path). Real
      NVDEC decode verification is Tier C.
- [ ] **"Same script" conformance example + test**: one example that runs end-to-end unchanged on
      CPU and on this Mac (asserts identical batch shapes across backends).

## P1 — Apple-Silicon GPU parity (Tier B — verify on this MacBook)

- [ ] **MPS path**: Torch tensors moved to `mps`; transforms run on MPS.
- [ ] **MLX transforms**: native `Resize`/`Crop`/`Normalize`/`Flip` in MLX so the transform script
      is identical on the MLX backend (today only MLX *output* conversion exists).
- [ ] **Throughput harness (Apple)**: frames/s on MLX & MPS vs CPU baseline; publish the table.

## P2 — NVIDIA path (Tier C — build now, functional verify on a GPU box)

- [ ] **CV-CUDA transform backend**: real `cvcuda` operators (resize/crop/normalize/augment,
      multi-camera batch transforms) behind the unified transforms API. *Verify on RTX 5090 / H100.*
- [ ] **NVDEC real-decode verification**: confirm the `-hwaccel cuda` path uses the Media/NVDEC
      engine (not software) on a real GPU; byte-correctness vs the CPU decode.
- [ ] **GPU-resident zero-copy** (`decode → DLPack → CV-CUDA`, no CPU hop): NVIDIA Video Codec SDK
      path so frames never leave the GPU. The CUDA analogue of the Apple `mlx#2855` zero-copy goal.
- [ ] **NVIDIA throughput benchmarks**: RTX 5090 / H100 / RunPod, vs LeRobot (torchcodec) + DALI.

> **Verification note:** P2 is implemented in this repo as feature-gated, compile-/lint-clean code
> with CPU fallbacks (so CI stays green on non-NVIDIA runners), but its functional pass/fail is
> only meaningful on NVIDIA hardware. Target a RunPod instance for sign-off before any release that
> claims a working CUDA/CV-CUDA path.

## Full feature backlog — sorted by ease of implementation

Same backlog as before, **re-sorted easiest → hardest** so you can grab quick wins first. Effort
is the cost of a *first working version* (GPU acceleration / verification adds cost, tagged `[C]`).
Within a tier, no-GPU items come first. Phase tag (`P1.1`, `P3`, …) is kept for lookup; trailing
status: 🟡 partial/not-wired · ⬜ not started.

**Effort key:** `XS` ≈ ≤1 day (wire/expose existing) · `S` ≈ 1–2 days (small module) ·
`M` ≈ 3–7 days (subsystem + integration) · `L` ≈ 1–2+ weeks (architecture/native/threading) ·
